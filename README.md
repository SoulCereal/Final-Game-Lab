# Final-Game-Lab
Project Goals: The goal for this project is to make a 2D platformer that would require the player to use two blocks in order to manuever obstacles and get through stages. 

Instructions: Make your way to the other side of a dungeon using your wits and blocks. Arrow keys to move.

Tech & Techniques: 
multiple screens
a level select
moving blocks
player movement

Process: I learned a lot while trying to make this. more specifically that you should ask for help when you need it. I got stuck a lot trying to do the collision detection, and I didn't even really fully figure it out. If i were to improve one thing i would definitely make it so that you can only move the blocks one or two times, however many times it would take to solve the puzzle I designed. I would start a lot sooner and ask for a lot more help if I were to do this again.
